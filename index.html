          This project served as an opportunity to both conduct competitive
          analysis in design elements and use a reactive frontend framework to
          build an interactive interface. My site uses React to develop a
          list-based interface for a mocked housing subletting site.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Our first goal was to conduct competitive analysis on sites with a
          favoriting function. I chose three:
          <br />
          <img src="table.png" alt="Competitive analysis table" />
          <br />
          For Princess Polly, I appreciated that the favorites page was easy to
          find, and could be accessed immediately from where the items were.
          However, I was unsure about the heart symbol itself– it’s not very
          immediately obvious and easy to click due to its size and thinness,
          and I think some ease of use and accessibility was sacrificed for the
          sake of aesthetics on this site. For Airbnb, the heart itself
          definitely has better contrast and visibility, but I’m still unsure
          how accessible it is for all users; while it is definitely a fairly
          widespread indicator of “favorited” or “liked” on online platforms, I
          do think that there is potential for confusion and difficulty for
          users that are less familiar or able to navigate sites as easily. I
          did appreciate the custom lists that automatically saved to the same
          lists when on the same search, as that feels like a good intermediate
          between custom lists and ease of use. For Pinterest, I appreciated the
          button having the word “save” on it rather than the heart symbol.
          However, I wasn’t a fan of how difficult it was to navigate to the
          page where it was saved, and that users had to hover in order to be
          able to view the save functionality.
          <br />
          <br />
          Using this as a baseline, I knew that I wanted to the button for
          saving to be clearly labeled with a word, and visible without hovering
          over the item. Additionally, I wanted the list to be easily accessible
          without needing complex navigation. I also appreciated the hover
          animation for the three sites, and though I find value in the custom
          lists, I think that is outside the scope of this project.

        <h2>Site Design</h2>
        <p>
          With a more clear design vision, I chose to create a mock Brown
          subletting site, something my friends and I had been in discussion
          about the need for. My intention was to create a site where users
          could search through (hypothetically uploaded) housing options based
          on various parameters. The sort features allow the default order or
          price sorting, while the filters allow users to choose parameters such
          as number of beds, type of housing, or the term they want to sublet
          for. Finally, there is a saved listing aggregator, which tracks what
          listings the user saves.
        </p>
        <img src="site.png" alt="a screenshot of the subletting site" />
        <p>
          Using components, props, and states, my interface allows for full
          functioanlity. Users are fully able to sort, aggregate, and filter the
          housing data provided with a dropdown menu for each parameter.

        <h2>Reflections and Future Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, this project encouraged me to take on new challenges in using
          reactive design components, and carefully consider the various forms
          that simple features like sorting or filtering or favoriting can take.
          I loved learning how to combine aesthetic design components with
          interactive interfaces. If I chose to implement this site beyond just
          the mocked front-end, future steps would include implementing my back
          end, ensuring security and authentification measures, integrating a
          map API, and creating a secure and anonymous email function. Either
          way, this project was a valuable experience in using reactive frontend
          frameworks to create more dynamic sites, and I'm looking forward to
          using these skills as I continue to create and improve.
