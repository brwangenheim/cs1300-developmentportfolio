        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Our first goal was to conduct competitive analysis on sites with a
          favoriting function.

          Overall, this project offered insight into the statistical models
          behind web design and A/B testing. Instead of relying solely on
          qualitative judgement to justify changes in a site, I now can utilize
          quantifiable methods to show change and improvement in user metrics
          between two versions of a site. With this newfound skillset, I am more
          prepared to navigate the iteration, prototyping, and testing process
          with confidence and surety.
